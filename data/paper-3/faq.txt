### FAQ: Lightweight Dynamic Build Batching Algorithms for Continuous Integration

#### 1) What problem does this paper solve and why is it important?
This paper addresses the **high cost of Continuous Integration (CI)** in software engineering. CI is a widely adopted quality assurance process where developers' pull requests are virtually merged with the codebase to perform essential builds and tests. However, CI is **an expensive process** due to the large number of pull requests pushed daily. Individual builds can **take hours to complete**, impacting developer productivity, and often multiple parallel builds are needed for different platforms or configurations. Large companies like Google and Mozilla report CI costs in **millions of dollars annually**. To mitigate these significant costs, the paper focuses on **reducing the number of scheduled CI builds**.

#### 2) What are the novel contributions compared to existing work?
The paper proposes a **fully online, more flexible dynamic batching technique called Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD)**. Compared to prior dynamic batching work by Bavand et al., which relies on a fixed lookup table generated offline from complex mathematical models, LWD **updates batch sizes only based on the outcome of the previous batch build** and can be **configured on-the-fly**. This approach leverages simple, lightweight techniques (including random ones) run after every build.

Key contributions include:
*   LWD algorithms can **save a median of 7.75% more builds than state-of-the-art static batching algorithms**.
*   The **performance of LWD algorithms is equally high as that of state-of-the-art dynamic batching**, despite being simpler.
*   This study performs the **first empirical study that combines batching with CI-Skip rules**, comparing their performance with individual batching techniques.
*   It finds that **CI-Skip does not significantly improve on the performance of dynamic batching algorithms** when combined.
*   The **replication package for this study is available online**.

#### 3) What methodology/approach did the authors use and why?
The authors focused on **rule-based heuristics** like CI-Skip and Batching, intentionally avoiding AI-based approaches due to their additional costs (data gathering, model training, retraining, prediction errors).

Their **Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD) approach** is based on **simple, local algorithms** that dynamically update batch sizes. It relies solely on:
*   The **failure rate of the most recent batch**.
*   **Simple arithmetic operations**.

LWD operates on four basic principles:
*   **Fallback Rule**: If the recent batch's failure rate exceeds a threshold, the next batch size defaults to 1 to avoid bisection overhead during failure streaks.
*   **Retention Rule**: If the recent batch has few failures and a successful final commit, the batch size is retained, anticipating fewer failures.
*   **Factor Rule**: New batch sizes are obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the current size by a factor (constant or random).
*   **Customizability Rule**: Customizable elements (e.g., maximum/minimum batch size, factor, retention/fallback limits) allow engineers to control CI batching based on project requirements.

The study presents **five main LWD variants**: Linear, Exponential, Random (atomic techniques with single conditions), and Mixed, Most Frequently Used (MFU) (composite techniques with if-else conditions). All LWD variants utilize **fallback algorithms** like BatchBisect, BatchStop4, or BatchDivide4 to identify culprit commits in failing batches.

For evaluation, the authors performed an **empirical study** using the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) template. They constructed a **build simulator** to sequentially replay build outcomes, calculating the number of builds needed for each batch. The performance metric used was the **percentage of builds saved** compared to the 'TestAll' baseline (where all commits are compiled individually). Statistical tests, including **Wilcoxon signed-rank tests** and **Friedman Test with post-hoc Conover tests**, were used to determine significance, with **Cliff’s Delta** and **Kendall’s W** for effect size.

#### 4) What are the key strengths of this research?
*   **Simplicity and Flexibility**: LWD is a **simple, rule-based heuristic** that can be **configured on-the-fly** and adapts to project needs without complex offline computations. This makes it more practical for real-world application.
*   **Customizability**: Build engineers have **fine-grained control** over batching practices, adjusting parameters like fallback limits, retention limits, and batch size factors to align with changing project contexts or software engineering phases (e.g., development, QA, maintenance).
*   **Explainability**: The straightforward arithmetic used in LWD makes batching decisions **easier for build engineers to understand**, unlike opaque "blackbox simulators" or machine learning models.
*   **Scalability**: LWD can be **applied from the first commit of a new project**, unlike previous dynamic batching algorithms that require historical data for initial setup.
*   **Strong Performance**: Empirically, LWD performs **equally well as the more complex state-of-the-art dynamic batching** techniques, and **saves a median of 4.75% more builds than static batching**.
*   **Large-scale Empirical Study**: The findings are supported by a **large-scale empirical study** on 286,848 commits from 50 open-source projects, enhancing the credibility of the results.
*   **Reproducibility**: The study provides a **replication package online**, allowing other researchers to verify and build upon their work.
*   **Adherence to Occam's Razor**: The research demonstrates that for CI problems, **simple, pragmatic solutions can be equally, if not more, effective** than complex intelligent methods, aligning with the principle of Occam's Razor.

#### 5) What are the main limitations or weaknesses?
*   **Performance Metrics**: The primary performance metric, "percentage of builds saved," **does not fully represent the time, computing resources, or energy conserved** by the heuristics. While the paper estimates wall-clock time saved, this analysis was limited to 41 out of 50 projects due to missing build duration data and used an approximation method.
*   **Dataset Specificity**: The study's focus on **Java-based projects** and **large, open-source projects (with at least 2,000 commits)** from a specific TravisTorrent release (Jan 25, 2017) limits the external validity. The results may not generalize to smaller projects, different programming languages, or other build/CI tools, including proprietary projects.
*   **Single Author Implementation**: All simulation scripts, data analysis, and processing were conducted by a single author, which could pose a **threat of human error and bias**.
*   **CI-Skip Effectiveness**: The integration of CI-Skip rules with dynamic batching **did not yield significant additional build savings**, suggesting its limited utility when combined with these batching techniques.
*   **Wall-clock Time Trade-off**: While LWD saves more builds than static batching, it **does not guarantee lower wall-clock time** than the baseline dynamic batching algorithm, which sometimes saved more time, particularly with certain fallback algorithms (BatchBisect and BatchDivide4). This implies a trade-off depending on whether build count or speed is prioritized.

#### 6) What datasets/experiments were conducted?
The study conducted a **large-scale empirical study on 286,848 commits from 50 open-source projects**.
*   **Data Source**: The dataset was collected from the **TravisTorrent data repository** (most recent dump as of January 25, 2017), which initially contained 3,881,992 builds from 948 projects.
*   **Data Filtering**:
    *   Filtered to **Java-based projects**, yielding 401,767 builds from 241 projects.
    *   Retained projects with **over 2,000 commits**, resulting in 53 projects.
    *   Limited to builds made only on the **"master" branch**.
    *   Filtered out the **first 100 builds** from each project for testing purposes.
    *   Eliminated 3 projects that then had fewer than 100 builds, resulting in the **final dataset of 50 projects**.
*   **Project Characteristics**: These 50 projects had failure rates varying from 5.84% to 98.32%.

The experiments addressed three research questions:
*   **RQ1: Best LWD Approach**: Evaluation of all five LWD batch updating techniques (Linear, Exponential, Random, Mixed, MFU) against each other to identify the most effective for dynamically updating batch sizes.
*   **RQ2: LWD vs. State-of-the-Art**: Comparison of LWD's performance against existing **static batching** techniques and **state-of-the-art dynamic batching** techniques.
*   **RQ3: CI-Skip Effectiveness**: Evaluation of the **combination of batching techniques with CI-Skip rules** to assess potential additional reduction in build scheduling.

For all experiments, various **fallback algorithms** (BatchBisect, BatchStop4, BatchDivide4) were applied to identify culprit commits in failing batches.

#### 7) How do the results compare to baselines or state-of-the-art?
The study provides a comprehensive comparison of LWD against existing batching techniques:

*   **LWD vs. Static Batching**:
    *   LWD variants consistently **outperform static batching techniques**.
    *   LWD saves a **median of 4.75% more builds** than static batching techniques.
    *   Specifically, LWD BatchBisect variants save a median 10.71% more builds, LWD BatchStop4 saves a median 4.75% more, and LWD BatchDivide4 saves 1.73% more compared to their static counterparts.
    *   Statistical analysis showed **significant differences** in favor of LWD for 41 out of 50 studied pairs, with large effect sizes (0.23 to 0.61).

*   **LWD vs. State-of-the-Art Dynamic Batching (Bavand et al.)**:
    *   Our LWD variants **perform equally well as the state-of-the-art dynamic batching technique**.
    *   Despite being simpler and requiring fewer resources (no offline simulation or repeated weighted failure rate calculations), LWD's performance matches the more complex baseline.
    *   Statistical tests showed **no significant difference** between any LWD variant and the baseline dynamic technique for any batching algorithm.

*   **Impact of CI-Skip Rules**:
    *   Integrating CI-Skip rules with **dynamic batching techniques (both LWD and baseline dynamic) does not correlate with significant additional build savings**.
    *   While CI-Skip rules alone saved a median of 5.51% builds, their combination with batching only added a median of 0.87% more savings.

*   **Wall-Clock Time Saved**:
    *   While LWD saves more builds than static batching, the **baseline dynamic batching algorithm saved the most median wall-clock time**.
    *   The difference in time saved between LWD and baseline dynamic batching was not statistically significant.
    *   For 33 out of 50 comparisons, **LWD saved significantly more time than static batching**. However, in some cases (e.g., Static BatchDivide4, Static BatchStop4-8/16), static batching either saved similar or more time compared to LWD or had no significant difference.

#### 8) What are potential applications of this work?
This research offers several practical applications for software development organizations:
*   **Optimizing CI Costs**: Companies can use LWD to **reduce the substantial costs** associated with CI, including time, energy, and computing resources, by scheduling fewer builds.
*   **Flexible CI Configuration**: Build engineers can **customize CI batching behavior on-the-fly**, adjusting parameters like fallback and retention limits, or maximum/minimum batch sizes, to **fit the evolving needs of a project** or the specific phase of the software development cycle.
*   **Adaptive Development Cycles**: During **new feature development**, engineers can configure LWD with more conservative limits (smaller batch sizes) to receive **earlier feedback** on code changes. Conversely, during **maintenance or bug fix phases**, higher batch sizes can be used to maximize build savings.
*   **Simplified Decision Making**: LWD's straightforward arithmetic computations make **batching decisions transparent and understandable** for build engineers, avoiding the "blackbox" nature of more complex or machine learning-based solutions.
*   **Immediate Application**: LWD can be applied to a **new project from its first commit** without requiring extensive historical data or offline pre-computation, making it readily deployable.
*   **Pragmatic Problem Solving**: The study highlights that **simple, pragmatic solutions can be equally effective** as highly intelligent or complex methods for certain CI challenges, offering a viable alternative where predictive accuracy might be difficult to guarantee.

#### 9) What future research directions does this enable?
The study outlines several avenues for future research:
*   **Broader Generalization**: Evaluating the proposed LWD heuristics on a **wider range of projects**, including:
    *   **Smaller projects** beyond the current focus on large projects.
    *   Projects using **different programming languages** (beyond Java).
    *   Projects utilizing **different build and CI tools** (beyond TravisCI).
    *   **Proprietary projects**, as their characteristics might differ from open-source ones.
*   **Deeper Cost Analysis**: Further investigation into the impact of LWD on other CI resources, such as **energy consumption** and **computing resources**, beyond just build count and wall-clock time.
*   **Adaptive Parameter Tuning**: Exploring methods for **dynamically adapting the factor values** or other customizable elements within LWD variants based on real-time project metrics or build history, rather than fixed experimental values.
*   **Automated LWD Variant Selection**: Research into mechanisms that can **automatically recommend or switch between different LWD variants** and configurations based on the project's current state or performance goals.
*   **Enhanced CI-Skip Integration**: Investigating alternative ways to combine CI-Skip rules or similar lightweight commit-skipping techniques with batching that could lead to more significant and measurable improvements in build savings.

#### 10) What are the technical challenges addressed?
The research directly addresses several technical challenges in Continuous Integration:
*   **Mitigating High CI Costs**: The primary challenge is to **reduce the substantial time, energy, and computing resources** consumed by CI builds, which can be very expensive for software organizations.
*   **Dynamic Batch Size Optimization**: A key challenge is to **dynamically determine the optimal number of commits to group into a single build batch**. This requires algorithms that can adapt batch sizes to avoid unnecessary builds during successful periods while minimizing overhead during failure streaks.
*   **Avoiding Offline Pre-computation**: Overcoming the limitation of prior dynamic batching techniques that require **extensive offline simulations and fixed lookup tables** for optimal batch sizes, which are complex to generate and lack flexibility. LWD tackles this by computing batch sizes on-the-fly.
*   **Efficient Culprit Identification**: When a batched build fails, the challenge is to **efficiently identify the individual failing commit(s)** without incurring excessive additional build overhead. This is addressed through the use of fallback algorithms like BatchBisect, BatchStop4, and BatchDivide4.
*   **Simplicity vs. Effectiveness Trade-off**: The paper aims to demonstrate that **simple, rule-based heuristics can be as effective as more complex AI-based or mathematically intensive approaches** for reducing CI costs, addressing the challenge of finding pragmatic solutions that are easy to understand and implement.
*   **Customizing CI Behavior**: Providing mechanisms for **build engineers to easily customize CI parameters** and adapt build behavior based on project-specific requirements or phases, without needing to re-simulate or re-train complex models.

#### 11) What assumptions does the work make?
The study operates under several assumptions, particularly in its methodology and generalizability:
*   **Build Duration Estimation for Wall-Clock Time**: When calculating wall-clock time saved, it assumes the duration of a batch build is approximated by the time taken for the **last commit of the batch**, plus any time for bisected batches if failures occur. This is an approximation and not 100% accurate.
*   **Commit Independence in Pre-Merge Testing**: It assumes that in pre-merge testing, changes from individual commits within a batch are typically independent. This implies that if any single commit in the batch fails, the entire batch will fail.
*   **Chronological Order of Commits**: The grouping of commits into batches is based on their chronological order.
*   **Representativeness of Dataset**: The study assumes that its dataset of **50 large, open-source Java projects from TravisTorrent** (master branch, filtered for >2000 commits) is sufficiently representative to draw general conclusions about the performance of the batching heuristics.
*   **Validity of CI-Skip Rules**: The effectiveness of integrating CI-Skip rules is based on a **specific set of 5 rules designed for Java-based projects**. The generalizability to other languages or rule sets is not covered.
*   **"Percentage of Builds Saved" as a Primary Metric**: While valuable, the study primarily relies on "percentage of builds saved" as the performance metric, assuming it adequately reflects the overall cost reduction in CI, despite not directly quantifying other resources like energy or CPU cycles.
*   **Limited Variance in Build Duration**: It is assumed that the duration of a build across commits of a given project has **only a limited variance over time**, supporting the observation that build duration results echo build savings results.

#### 12) How reproducible is this research?
This research places a strong emphasis on reproducibility:
*   **Online Replication Package**: The authors have made their **replication package publicly available online**. This package includes the datasets generated and analyzed during the study, which is crucial for others to replicate the experiments.
*   **Reliance on Prior Replication Packages**: For baseline comparisons (static and dynamic batching), the study explicitly states it **relied on the batching simulators and replication packages from prior work** by Beheshtian et al. and Bavand et al. to ensure consistent replication of those techniques on their dataset.
*   **Detailed Methodology and Algorithms**: The paper provides a **comprehensive description of the study methodology**, including data selection, filtering criteria, the various LWD variants and their underlying algorithms (e.g., Algorithms 1-11), and evaluation metrics. This level of detail enables others to reconstruct the experimental setup.
*   **Explicit Parameter Settings**: Key customizable parameters for LWD variants, such as the default starting batch size (16), retention limit (20%), fallback limit (40%), maximum allowed batch size (16 commits), and factor values (e.g., {2, 3} for Exponential, Mixed, MFU), are **clearly stated**.
*   **Standard Statistical Tests**: The use of well-established statistical tests like Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Friedman Test, and post-hoc Conover tests, along with reporting of p-values and effect sizes (Cliff’s Delta, Kendall’s W), contributes to reproducibility and enables others to verify the statistical conclusions.
*   **Mitigation of Internal Validity Threats**: While acknowledging the risk of human error from a single author, the authors state they carefully used existing replication packages to minimize this threat.
