## STRENGTHS

**Strength 1:** Innovative Simplicity in Dynamic Batching
The paper introduces Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD), a novel, fully online algorithm that updates batch sizes based solely on the failure rate of the previous batch, adhering to Occam's Razor by favoring simpler solutions. Unlike prior dynamic batching by Bavand et al., which relies on offline-generated lookup tables and complex weighted failure rates, LWD uses basic arithmetic operations (e.g., Linear variant increments/decrements by a factor like 3) and four principles (Fallback, Retention, Factor, Customizability). This simplicity enables on-the-fly configuration without historical data, as demonstrated in its five variants (Linear, Exponential, Random, Mixed, MFU), which perform equally well as state-of-the-art methods while saving a median of 4.75% more builds than static batching.

**Strength 2:** Rigorous Large-Scale Empirical Evaluation
The methodology employs a custom build simulator to replay 286,848 commits from 50 Java-based open-source projects on TravisCI, evaluating LWD against baselines like TestAll, static batching (fixed sizes 2-16), and state-of-the-art dynamic batching with three fallback algorithms (BatchBisect, BatchStop4, BatchDivide4). Statistical tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank, Friedman with Conover post-hoc) confirm significant improvements, such as LWD BatchStop4 saving 4.75% more builds than static counterparts (p<0.05, large Cliffâ€™s Delta 0.23-0.61). This thorough analysis, addressing three RQs, validates LWD's equivalence to complex methods and limited CI-Skip benefits (median 0.87% additional savings).

**Strength 3:** High Customizability and Practical Applicability
LWD's Customizability Rule allows engineers to adjust parameters like maximum batch size (set to 16), retention limit (20%), fallback limit (40%), and factors (e.g., 2 or 3 in Exponential variants) to suit project phases, such as conservative sizes during development for early feedback. This flexibility, combined with its immediate applicability from a project's first commit, enhances real-world utility. The replication package further supports adoption, enabling verification and extension, while emphasizing local knowledge over global models for explainable decisions.

## LIMITATIONS

**Limitation 1:** Restricted Dataset Generalizability
The study is confined to 50 large, open-source Java projects from TravisTorrent (filtered to >2,000 commits, master branch), with failure rates from 5.84% to 98.32%. This focus limits external validity, as results may not extend to smaller projects, non-Java languages, proprietary codebases, or other CI tools beyond TravisCI. For instance, CI-Skip rules are Java-specific, potentially skewing the finding of minimal additional savings (0.87%) when combined with batching, which matters because it could misrepresent LWD's performance in diverse ecosystems.

**Limitation 2:** Incomplete Resource Cost Metrics
The primary metric, percentage of builds saved (e.g., LWD's median 37.38%-48.86%), does not fully capture time, energy, or computing costs; wall-clock time estimates were approximated for only 41 projects (using last commit duration plus bisection), introducing inaccuracies. This weakness is significant, as the paper notes baseline dynamic batching sometimes saves more time despite equivalent build savings, potentially leading to overstated benefits if organizations prioritize runtime over build count.

**Limitation 3:** Potential Bias from Single-Author Implementation
All simulation, data processing, and analysis were conducted by one author, raising internal validity risks like human error or bias in scripts, despite mitigation via prior replication packages. This could affect reliability of results, such as variant comparisons (e.g., Linear-4 BatchStop4's top performance at 45.57% median savings), and matters because it undermines confidence in the empirical claims without multi-author verification or automated checks.

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS

**Suggestion 1:** Expand Evaluation to Diverse Project Types
Future work could assess LWD on smaller projects (<2,000 commits), non-Java languages, and proprietary datasets using varied CI tools like Jenkins. This would enhance generalizability, building on the current TravisCI focus, and provide value by validating if LWD's build savings (e.g., 4.75% over static) hold across scales, potentially revealing adaptations for resource-constrained environments.

**Suggestion 2:** Incorporate Comprehensive Cost Metrics
Researchers should integrate direct measurements of energy consumption and CPU usage into the build simulator, beyond build count and approximated wall-clock time. This feasible extension, motivated by the paper's acknowledgment of metric limitations, would offer a holistic view of CI savings, enabling comparisons like LWD versus AI approaches and guiding cost-optimized configurations.

**Suggestion 3:** Explore Adaptive Hybrid Strategies
Investigate mechanisms for dynamically switching LWD variants or integrating with CI-Skip/AI elements based on real-time metrics (e.g., failure streaks). This could use online learning to adjust factors, addressing the paper's finding of variant-fallback interactions (e.g., Exponential with BatchDivide4), and add value by creating resilient systems that adapt to project phases, improving overall CI efficiency.
