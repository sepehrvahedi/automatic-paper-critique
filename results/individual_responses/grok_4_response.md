## STRENGTHS

**Strength 1:** Simplicity and Comparable Performance to State-of-the-Art
The paper introduces Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD), a simple, fully online algorithm that updates batch sizes based solely on the previous batch's failure rate, avoiding offline lookup tables and complex historical data required by prior dynamic batching techniques like Bavand et al.'s approach. Despite its simplicity, empirical results across 286,848 commits from 50 projects show LWD performs equally well, saving a median of 37.38% to 48.86% builds compared to the TestAll baseline, with no statistical difference from the state-of-the-art. This aligns with Occam's Razor, demonstrating that lightweight, local-knowledge-based methods can match more resource-intensive global models, making LWD practical for real-world CI optimization.

**Strength 2:** Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation and Reproducibility
The study employs a rigorous methodology, including a custom build simulator to replay commit outcomes and statistical tests (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests with Bonferroni correction) to compare LWD variants against static and dynamic baselines. For instance, RQ2 shows LWD saves a median 4.75% more builds than static batching, with significant differences in 41 of 50 pairs (large Cliff’s Delta effect sizes of 0.23–0.61). The provision of an online replication package, including datasets and scripts, enhances reproducibility, building on prior works' packages for baselines, which strengthens the validity and allows easy verification.

**Strength 3:** Customizability and Practical Flexibility
LWD's design incorporates four principles (fallback, retention, factor, and customizability rules) that enable on-the-fly configuration of parameters like batch size limits, factors (e.g., 2 or 3 for exponential variants), and thresholds (e.g., 40% fallback limit). This is exemplified in variants like Linear-4 BatchStop4, which achieved the highest median build savings (45.57%), allowing engineers to adapt to project phases (e.g., conservative sizes during development for quicker feedback). By combining with fallback algorithms like BatchBisect or BatchDivide4, LWD offers flexible, explainable heuristics that outperform static methods without AI overhead.

## LIMITATIONS

**Limitation 1:** Dataset Specificity and External Validity
The evaluation is restricted to 50 large, open-source Java projects from TravisTorrent (with at least 2,000 commits and master-branch builds), potentially limiting generalizability to smaller projects, other languages, or proprietary systems. For example, CI-Skip rules were designed for Java, and failure rates varied from 5.84% to 98.32% in this dataset, but results may not hold for non-Java ecosystems or tools beyond TravisCI, risking overestimation of LWD's applicability in diverse CI environments.

**Limitation 2:** Incomplete Performance Metrics
The primary metric, percentage of builds saved, does not fully capture wall-clock time, energy, or resource savings; time estimates were approximated for only 41 projects (using last-commit duration plus bisection), potentially underrepresenting real costs. For instance, while LWD saved more builds than static batching, the baseline dynamic approach often saved more median time with BatchBisect and BatchDivide4, highlighting a trade-off where build count reductions do not always translate to proportional time savings, which could mislead practical adoption.

**Limitation 3:** Risk of Internal Bias from Single-Author Implementation
All simulation, data processing, and analysis were conducted by one author, introducing potential human error or bias in scripts and data handling, despite mitigation via prior replication packages. This is critical as the build simulator replays 286,848 commits across 39 LWD sub-variants, and any undetected flaws could affect results, such as the non-significant improvements from CI-Skip integration (median 0.87% additional savings), undermining confidence in the findings without multi-author validation.

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS

**Suggestion 1:** Evaluate on Diverse Languages and Project Scales
Future work could extend LWD evaluation to non-Java projects (e.g., Python or C++) and smaller or proprietary repositories using datasets like GitHub Actions or Jenkins logs. This would assess generalizability, potentially revealing language-specific optimizations (e.g., adapting CI-Skip rules), and add value by providing broader evidence for LWD's effectiveness, addressing the current Java-centric bias.

**Suggestion 2:** Develop Adaptive Parameter Optimization Mechanisms
Researchers could investigate machine learning or heuristic-based methods to dynamically tune LWD parameters (e.g., factors or thresholds) in real-time based on ongoing build metrics, rather than fixed values like factor 2 for exponential variants. This feasible extension, building on the customizability rule, would enhance performance during varying project phases, offering value through automated, context-aware batching that maximizes savings without manual intervention.

**Suggestion 3:** Analyze Broader Resource Impacts Beyond Builds
A deeper study could measure LWD's effects on energy consumption and CPU usage using real CI hardware traces, comparing against baselines with precise metrics (e.g., integrating power profiling tools). This would address the metric limitation by quantifying holistic savings, providing valuable insights for sustainable CI practices in resource-constrained environments like cloud-based systems.
