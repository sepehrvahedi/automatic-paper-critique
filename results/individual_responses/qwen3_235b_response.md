## STRENGTHS  

**Strength 1: Lightweight Online Adaptation Without Historical Data Dependency**  
The paper introduces LWD, a dynamic batching algorithm that eliminates the need for offline precomputation or historical data storage, a critical limitation of prior state-of-the-art dynamic batching methods. By relying solely on the failure rate of the immediately preceding batch, LWD reduces computational overhead and simplifies implementation. For instance, the algorithm’s “Retention Rule” retains batch sizes when the previous batch had low failure rates and a successful final commit, while the “Fallback Rule” resets batch sizes to 1 after high-failure batches to minimize bisection overhead. This approach is validated through empirical testing on 286,848 commits across 50 open-source Java projects, demonstrating that LWD variants like Linear-4 BatchStop4 achieve median build savings of 45.57%, comparable to complex models requiring offline lookup tables. The authors explicitly contrast this with Bavand et al.’s method, which depends on weighted smoothing and historical failure rates, highlighting LWD’s practicality for projects lacking historical data.  

**Strength 2: Customizable and Explainable Batching Policies**  
LWD’s design allows engineers to tailor parameters such as maximum/minimum batch sizes, fallback thresholds (e.g., 40% failure rate), and arithmetic update rules (e.g., factor-based linear or exponential adjustments). This flexibility is exemplified by the MFU variant, which defaults to the most frequently used batch size for a project during high-failure scenarios, adapting dynamically to project-specific patterns. The transparency of LWD’s rules—such as the “Factor Rule” using simple arithmetic operations—contrasts with opaque AI-based approaches, enabling engineers to debug and refine batching strategies without relying on black-box models. The authors emphasize this through comparisons with CI-Skip rules, which are similarly interpretable but less effective when combined with batching. The reproducibility of these results is further strengthened by an online replication package, including code and datasets, ensuring other teams can implement and customize LWD with minimal effort.  

**Strength 3: Robust Empirical Evaluation of Batching Trade-offs**  
The study rigorously evaluates 39 LWD sub-variants against static and dynamic baselines, using statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Friedman) and effect size metrics (Cliff’s Delta, Kendall’s W) to validate significance. For example, the Linear-4 BatchStop4 variant outperformed 41 of 50 static batching pairs with large effect sizes (0.23–0.61), demonstrating LWD’s superiority in reducing build counts. The paper also empirically disentangles interactions between batching strategies and fallback algorithms: Exponential variants perform better with BatchDivide4, while Linear variants excel with BatchStop4. This granular analysis provides actionable insights for practitioners, such as the recommendation to use Factor 2 for most composite LWD variants. Additionally, the study’s large-scale evaluation—spanning projects with failure rates from 5.84% to 98.32%—underscores the robustness of LWD across diverse project dynamics.  

## LIMITATIONS  

**Limitation 1: Restricted Dataset Scope Limits Generalizability**  
The study focuses exclusively on **Java-based, large open-source projects** with ≥2,000 commits, filtered from the TravisTorrent dataset (2017 release). While this ensures consistency with CI-Skip rules optimized for Java, it raises concerns about external validity. For example, projects in languages requiring stricter build dependencies (e.g., C++) or those using CI tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions may exhibit different batching behaviors. The exclusion of smaller projects (n < 2,000 commits) further limits insights into LWD’s performance in early-stage or low-activity repositories. The authors acknowledge this in Section 6, noting that proprietary projects or non-Java ecosystems might yield divergent results, but no cross-language or industry validation is provided.  

**Limitation 2: Over-Reliance on “Builds Saved” as a Proxy Metric**  
The primary evaluation metric—“percentage of builds saved” compared to TestAll—omits critical real-world cost dimensions like **wall-clock time, energy consumption, or developer wait times**. While the authors attempt to estimate time savings for 41 projects, their approximation assumes batch durations equal the time of the last commit plus bisection overhead, which may not account for parallelized testing or dependencies between commits. For instance, LWD BatchBisect variants saved 10.71% more builds than static batching but did not guarantee faster feedback loops: the baseline dynamic batching algorithm sometimes outperformed LWD in wall-clock time savings (e.g., with BatchBisect). This gap leaves unanswered whether LWD’s build reductions translate into tangible operational cost savings for CI systems.  

**Limitation 3: CI-Skip Integration Offers Marginal Gains**  
The paper’s exploration of CI-Skip rules—a technique to skip builds for low-risk commits—reveals limited synergy with dynamic batching. While CI-Skip alone saves 5.51% of builds, combining it with LWD or state-of-the-art dynamic batching adds only **0.87% median savings**. This suggests that dynamic batching primarily optimizes failure scenarios, where CI-Skip is inapplicable (since it targets successful commits). The authors attribute this to batching’s focus on reducing overhead during failure streaks, but the lack of deeper analysis into complementary commit-skipping strategies (e.g., machine learning-based skip rules) or alternative integration approaches (e.g., post-batching skipping) weakens the paper’s contribution to holistic CI optimization.  

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS  

**Suggestion 1: Cross-Language and Cross-Tool Validation of LWD**  
Extending LWD to projects in languages like Python or C++, and CI tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions, would address its current Java/TravisCI specificity. Such research should investigate whether LWD’s local failure-rate-driven updates generalize to ecosystems with different build dependencies or failure patterns. For example, Python projects with less rigid compile-time checks might experience higher inter-commit dependencies, affecting batching efficiency. This would involve recalibrating LWD’s failure thresholds (e.g., retention limit of 20%) and fallback algorithms to account for language-specific build behaviors, ensuring the approach remains lightweight while broadening its applicability.  

**Suggestion 2: Dynamic Optimization of LWD’s Configurable Parameters**  
The paper’s customizability strength could be enhanced by automating parameter tuning (e.g., fallback limits, arithmetic factors) using real-time project metrics. For instance, a hybrid approach could adjust the “Factor Rule” based on recent build durations or failure rate trends, avoiding manual selection of constants like Factor 2 or 3. This aligns with the authors’ future work on adaptive strategy switching (Section 7) but requires concrete mechanisms, such as reinforcement learning policies or rule-based triggers for parameter changes. A potential experiment could compare automatically adjusted Linear LWD variants against fixed-factor baselines, measuring stability and convergence in dynamic environments.  

**Suggestion 3: Integrated Prioritization of Build-Time and Build-Count Optimization**  
The study’s focus on build count neglects trade-offs between faster feedback loops and resource savings. Future work should propose a unified optimization framework that balances these metrics, particularly for high-stakes environments where wall-clock time impacts deployment urgency. For example, a cost function could weigh LWD’s build savings against the risk of delayed feedback for critical commits. This direction is partially motivated by the authors’ observation that baseline dynamic batching occasionally outperformed LWD in wall-clock time savings, suggesting a need for adaptive strategies that switch between batching algorithms based on real-time priorities (e.g., using LWD during low-failure periods and state-of-the-art dynamic batching during high-failure periods). Such a framework would require lightweight monitoring of CI system status and failure trends.
