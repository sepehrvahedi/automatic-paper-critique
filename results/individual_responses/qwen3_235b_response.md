## STRENGTHS  

**Strength 1:** *Adherence to Occam's Razor with Simplified Dynamic Batching*  
The paper’s introduction of Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD) exemplifies Occam’s Razor by achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art dynamic batching techniques while eliminating complex offline computations. Unlike Bavand et al.’s approach, which relies on precomputed lookup tables and weighted failure rates over historical data, LWD dynamically adjusts batch sizes based solely on the failure rate of the **immediately preceding batch**. For example, the Linear-4 BatchStop4 variant achieved a median of 45.57% build savings without requiring historical data, demonstrating that local, rule-based updates can match global models. This simplicity reduces overhead, making LWD more practical for real-time CI systems, as evidenced by its ability to function from a project’s first commit without offline setup.  

**Strength 2:** *Large-Scale Empirical Validation Across Diverse Projects*  
The study rigorously evaluated LWD on **286,848 commits across 50 open-source Java projects** with varying failure rates (5.84%–98.32%). This scale surpasses prior batching studies, which often focused on smaller datasets (e.g., Bavand et al.’s evaluation on 12 projects). The authors used **Wilcoxon signed-rank tests** and **Friedman tests with Conover post-hoc analysis**, revealing statistically significant improvements over static batching (41/50 comparisons) and performance parity with state-of-the-art dynamic batching. For instance, LWD BatchBisect saved **10.71% more builds than static batching**, while Exponential-2 variants under LWD achieved strong median savings. This empirical robustness strengthens confidence in LWD’s practical utility.  

**Strength 3:** *Practical Customizability for Real-World CI Systems*  
LWD’s design emphasizes **engineer-driven configurability**, allowing adjustments to max/min batch sizes, fallback limits (e.g., 40% failure rate triggering single-commit batches), and arithmetic factors (e.g., factor 3 for Linear LWD). This flexibility was validated through **five LWD variants** (Linear, Exponential, Random, Mixed, MFU) and three fallback algorithms (BatchBisect, BatchStop4, BatchDivide4), enabling tailored use cases. For example, during development phases, engineers might favor the MFU variant to default to historically frequent batch sizes, while maintenance phases could prioritize larger batches via Exponential-2. This adaptability aligns with industry needs, as highlighted in the paper’s discussion of proprietary project requirements.  

## LIMITATIONS  

**Limitation 1:** *Narrow Dataset Scope Limiting Generalizability*  
The study focused exclusively on **Java-based, large open-source projects** (≥2,000 commits) using TravisCI, filtered from the TravisTorrent dataset (2017 release). This excludes projects in other languages (e.g., Python, C++) and proprietary systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions), limiting external validity. For instance, the CI-Skip rules integrated into the analysis were designed for Java, as noted in the FAQ, which may not apply to projects where non-code changes (e.g., binary files) dominate. Additionally, the exclusion of smaller projects (e.g., <2,000 commits) risks overlooking scenarios where dynamic batching could yield disproportionate benefits due to less stable build patterns.  

**Limitation 2:** *Over-Reliance on Build Count as the Primary Metric*  
While the paper measures success via **“percentage of builds saved”** relative to TestAll, this metric **does not directly quantify time, energy, or computational resource savings**—key cost drivers in CI systems. The authors approximated wall-clock time savings for 41/50 projects but relied on simplifications: batch durations were estimated as the last commit’s build time plus bisection overhead, ignoring parallelization or resource contention. For example, LWD BatchBisect saved more builds than baseline dynamic batching but underperformed in wall-clock time for certain fallback algorithms (e.g., BatchDivide4), suggesting a potential disconnect between build count reduction and real-world efficiency.  

**Limitation 3:** *Inconclusive Impact of CI-Skip Integration*  
Although the paper pioneers the empirical combination of batching and CI-Skip rules, the integration yielded **only marginal additional savings** (median: 0.87% builds saved). This likely stems from methodological constraints: CI-Skip rules were applied **before batching**, filtering out skippable commits entirely. However, the authors acknowledge that batching’s primary benefit lies in reducing overhead during failure streaks, while CI-Skip mostly targets non-failing commits. Without exploring alternative integration strategies (e.g., skipping within batches or prioritizing CI-Skip during high-success phases), the analysis fails to fully address synergies between these techniques, leaving their combined potential underexplored.  

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS  

**Suggestion 1:** *Cross-Language and Tool Evaluation of LWD*  
The paper’s focus on Java and TravisCI necessitates validation across **diverse programming ecosystems** (e.g., Python, C++) and modern CI platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions). For instance, projects with different build failure patterns (e.g., machine learning repositories with frequent dependency changes) might benefit differently from LWD’s local feedback loop. This research direction aligns with the authors’ own future work proposals and would strengthen external validity by testing whether LWD’s principles—reliance on recent batch outcomes—are universally applicable or language/tool-specific.  

**Suggestion 2:** *Comprehensive Resource Efficiency Analysis*  
Future studies should quantify LWD’s impact on **wall-clock time, energy consumption, and compute resource utilization**, not just build counts. The current wall-clock time analysis was limited to 41 projects and used approximations (e.g., batch duration = last commit’s build time), which may misrepresent parallelized CI systems where batch builds run faster than individual ones. A deeper analysis could leverage resource profiling tools to measure CPU/memory usage or model energy costs, as suggested in the paper’s future work, providing a holistic view of LWD’s value in resource-constrained environments.  

**Suggestion 3:** *Adaptive Hybridization of Batching and CI-Skip Strategies*  
The paper’s CI-Skip integration applied skippable commit filtering **before batching**, but the limited gains (0.87% median) suggest a need for more nuanced combinations. Future work could explore **dynamic prioritization**: for instance, allowing CI-Skip rules to influence batching granularity (e.g., larger batches for skippable commits, smaller batches for non-skippable ones). Alternatively, integrating CI-Skip into fallback algorithms (e.g., skipping rebuilds for documentation-only commits during bisection) might amplify savings. This direction aligns with the authors’ call for enhanced CI-Skip integration and could bridge the observed gap in combined batching-CI-Skip performance.
