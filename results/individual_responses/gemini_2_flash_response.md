## STRENGTHS

**Strength 1: Simplicity and Flexibility of the LWD Approach**

The most significant strength of this paper lies in the introduction of Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD), a dynamic batching technique that prioritizes simplicity and flexibility. Unlike the state-of-the-art dynamic batching method, which requires offline generated lookup tables based on complex calculations of failure rates using mathematical models and weighted smoothing, LWD updates batch sizes solely based on the outcome of the immediately preceding batch build. This "local knowledge" approach makes it more practical for real-world implementation. For instance, the Fallback Rule, which defaults the batch size to 1 if the recent batch's failure rate exceeds a given threshold (40% in the experiment), is a straightforward yet effective way to avoid unnecessary bisection overhead. Furthermore, LWD's customizability, allowing engineers to configure parameters like fallback limits and factor values (e.g., Linear LWD variants with factors of 1, 3, or 4), provides fine-grained control over batching behavior, enhancing its adaptability to diverse project needs.

**Strength 2: Strong Empirical Validation and Performance Equivalence**

The authors conducted a rigorous empirical evaluation of LWD across 50 open-source Java projects (286,848 commits) using a build simulator. This extensive dataset and the careful selection of projects with varying failure rates (5.84% to 98.32%) strengthens the validity of the findings. The results demonstrate that LWD can achieve performance equivalent to the more complex state-of-the-art dynamic batching technique. Specifically, the study found no statistically significant difference between any LWD variant and the baseline dynamic technique. This supports Occam's Razor, suggesting that simpler solutions can be just as effective as complex ones. Furthermore, LWD consistently outperformed static batching, saving a median of 4.75% more builds. The use of appropriate statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Friedman, Conover) and effect size measurements (Cliff’s Delta, Kendall’s W) further bolsters the credibility of the empirical findings.

**Strength 3: Focus on Practical Applicability and Explainability**

The paper explicitly avoids AI-based approaches, which, while potentially effective, introduce complexities related to data gathering, model training, and potential prediction errors. Instead, the LWD technique is designed with practical applicability and explainability in mind. The simple arithmetic operations used in LWD (e.g., Linear LWD variants incrementing/decrementing the batch size by a constant factor) make batching decisions easier for build engineers to understand and debug. This contrasts with the "blackbox" nature of some AI-based solutions. The emphasis on customizability also enhances practical applicability, allowing build engineers to fine-tune LWD parameters to suit their specific project requirements and CI workflows, whether in development, testing, or maintenance phases.

## LIMITATIONS

**Limitation 1: Limited Generalizability Due to Dataset Specificity**

The study’s focus on Java-based projects sourced from a specific TravisTorrent data dump (January 25, 2017) and filtered for projects with over 2,000 commits presents a significant limitation to the generalizability of the results. The LWD approach was tailored around Java CI-Skip rules. The paper acknowledges that these Java-specific rules may not translate directly to other languages. Furthermore, the restriction to large, open-source projects might not accurately reflect the characteristics and build patterns of smaller projects or proprietary codebases, which could exhibit different commit frequencies, failure rates, and build complexities. This limits the extent to which the findings can be applied to a broader range of software development contexts.

**Limitation 2: Reliance on "Percentage of Builds Saved" as the Primary Metric**

While the "percentage of builds saved" is a useful metric for quantifying the reduction in CI build scheduling, it does not fully capture the overall cost savings associated with different batching techniques. The paper acknowledges that this metric does not directly represent the time, computing resources, or energy conserved. Although the authors estimated wall-clock time saved for a subset of the projects, this estimation relied on simplifying assumptions (e.g., approximating batch build duration based on the last commit's time), potentially introducing inaccuracies. A more comprehensive cost analysis, considering factors such as CPU utilization, memory consumption, and energy usage, would provide a more holistic assessment of the economic benefits of LWD.

**Limitation 3: Lack of Significant Improvement with CI-Skip Integration**

The study’s finding that the addition of CI-Skip rules to dynamic batching techniques (both LWD and baseline dynamic) did not result in significant additional build savings raises concerns about the effectiveness of this integration strategy. While CI-Skip rules alone did save a median of 5.51% of builds, their combination with batching only added a median of 0.87% to the savings. This suggests that the benefits of CI-Skip rules are largely redundant when combined with dynamic batching. This warrants further investigation into alternative approaches for integrating commit-skipping techniques with batching or a deeper understanding of why the current integration method is not more effective. It questions the added complexity of combining the techniques.

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS

**Suggestion 1: Exploring Adaptive Parameter Tuning for LWD**

Future research should investigate methods for dynamically adapting the parameter values of LWD variants (e.g., factor values, retention/fallback limits) based on real-time project metrics or build history. Instead of relying on fixed parameter values determined through experimentation, an adaptive tuning mechanism could optimize LWD's performance over time as the project evolves. For instance, the system could monitor the failure rate of batches and automatically adjust the fallback limit or the batch size factor to maintain a desired balance between build savings and detection latency. This adaptive tuning could significantly improve the robustness and effectiveness of LWD in dynamic development environments.

**Suggestion 2: Evaluating LWD in Diverse Software Development Contexts**

To address the limitations of the current study’s dataset, future research should evaluate LWD in a more diverse range of software development contexts. This includes testing LWD on smaller projects, projects using different programming languages (beyond Java), projects utilizing alternative build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and projects using different CI platforms (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI). Additionally, investigating the performance of LWD in proprietary projects would provide valuable insights into its applicability in commercial software development settings. This broader evaluation would help to assess the generalizability and robustness of LWD across different software development environments.

**Suggestion 3: Investigating Alternative Integration Strategies for Commit-Skipping Techniques**

Given the limited improvement observed when integrating CI-Skip rules with dynamic batching in the current study, future research should explore alternative integration strategies for commit-skipping techniques. This could involve developing new rules that are more complementary to dynamic batching algorithms, or exploring more sophisticated methods for combining the two techniques. For example, instead of applying CI-Skip rules before batching, the system could dynamically adjust the batch size based on the proportion of skippable commits within a potential batch. This could potentially lead to more significant and measurable improvements in build savings by leveraging the strengths of both commit-skipping and dynamic batching.
