## STRENGTHS

**Strength 1: Lightweight and Flexible Dynamic Batching Approach**

The paper's primary strength lies in the introduction of Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD), a novel approach to dynamic build batching that is both lightweight and flexible. Unlike the state-of-the-art dynamic batching technique by Bavand et al., which relies on computationally expensive offline simulations and fixed lookup tables, LWD updates batch sizes solely based on the outcome of the immediately preceding batch build (the failure rate). This "local knowledge" approach significantly reduces computational overhead and allows for on-the-fly configuration changes to adapt to specific project needs. The simplicity of LWD, based on arithmetic operations and customizable parameters such as retention and fallback limits, makes it more readily deployable and understandable than more complex methods. The five LWD variants (Linear, Exponential, Random, Mixed, and MFU), combined with different fallback algorithms (BatchBisect, BatchStop4, and BatchDivide4), provide a versatile toolkit for build engineers.

**Strength 2: Empirical Validation and Performance Equivalence**

The empirical evaluation across 286,848 commits from 50 open-source projects using TravisCI provides strong support for the efficacy of LWD. The results demonstrate that LWD achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art dynamic batching technique, while significantly outperforming static batching. The authors demonstrate that LWD variants save a median of 4.75% more builds than static batching, with statistically significant differences observed in 41 out of 50 studied pairs of heuristics, and large effect sizes (0.23 to 0.61). The absence of a statistically significant difference between LWD and the baseline dynamic approach is particularly compelling, supporting the claim that LWD, despite its simpler design, is equally effective. These findings align with Occam's Razor, favoring the simpler LWD approach.

**Strength 3: Comprehensive Evaluation Methodology and Statistical Analysis**

The paper employs a rigorous evaluation methodology, including a custom build simulator to replay build outcomes and a clearly defined performance metric (percentage of builds saved). The authors use appropriate statistical tests, including Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (for 2 paired distributions) and Friedman tests with post-hoc Conover tests (for >2 paired distributions) to identify significant differences. They also address the potential for Type-I errors by applying Bonferroni correction. The inclusion of effect sizes (Cliff’s Delta and Kendall’s W) provides further context for interpreting the statistical significance of the results. The availability of a replication package strengthens the study's credibility and facilitates independent verification and extension of the findings.

## LIMITATIONS

**Limitation 1: Limited Generalizability of Dataset**

The study's focus on Java-based projects and large, open-source repositories from a specific snapshot of TravisTorrent (January 25, 2017) limits the generalizability of the results. The dataset filtering process, while necessary for focusing the study, removed a substantial portion of the initial data, raising concerns about potential selection bias. The paper explicitly acknowledges that the results may not hold for smaller projects, projects using different programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), or projects employing different CI/CD tools. Since CI systems and build practices can vary significantly across different contexts, the extent to which LWD's performance generalizes to other settings remains an open question.

**Limitation 2: Narrow Performance Metric and Resource Considerations**

The primary performance metric, "percentage of builds saved," while useful for quantifying the reduction in CI activity, does not fully capture the complexity of CI costs. Factors such as build duration, resource consumption (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), and energy expenditure are not directly accounted for. The approximation of wall-clock time saved, based on the time for the last commit plus bisection time, introduces another source of potential inaccuracy. As the authors note, build duration varied depending on factors that were not easily controlled. While LWD reduces the number of builds, it doesn't guarantee a reduction in all cost factors; a few long-running builds could negate the savings from numerous smaller builds.

**Limitation 3: Limited Impact of CI-Skip Integration**

The finding that integrating CI-Skip rules with dynamic batching (LWD and the baseline approach) did not yield significant additional build savings is a notable limitation. While CI-Skip rules alone are effective, their combination with dynamic batching offered only marginal improvements. This suggests that the benefits of CI-Skip and dynamic batching may not be additive, possibly due to overlapping coverage. This outcome raises questions about the incremental value of CI-Skip in conjunction with LWD and underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of their interaction.

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS

**Suggestion 1: Explore Adaptive LWD Parameter Tuning**

Future research should investigate adaptive strategies for tuning LWD parameters dynamically based on project characteristics and build history. Instead of relying on fixed values for parameters like retention limit, fallback limit, and factor values, the system could automatically adjust these parameters based on performance metrics such as build success rate, build duration, and resource utilization. Machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, could be employed to learn optimal parameter configurations for different project profiles and CI environments. This adaptive approach could further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LWD by tailoring it to the specific needs of each project.

**Suggestion 2: Investigate Language-Specific CI-Skip Rules and their Integration with LWD**

Given the limited impact of the existing CI-Skip rules, future work should explore the development and integration of language-specific CI-Skip rules that are tailored to the characteristics of different programming languages and build tools. For example, CI-Skip rules for Python projects could focus on changes to documentation or whitespace, while rules for C++ projects could target header file modifications. Furthermore, research should investigate alternative strategies for combining CI-Skip rules with LWD that could lead to more significant build savings. For example, CI-Skip rules could be applied selectively based on the current batch size or build history.

**Suggestion 3: Evaluate LWD in Diverse CI/CD Environments**

Future research should evaluate the performance of LWD in a wider range of CI/CD environments, including proprietary projects, cloud-based CI platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), and containerized build environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes). This would involve collecting data on build outcomes, resource consumption, and cost factors from diverse projects and CI/CD configurations. The results of these evaluations could provide valuable insights into the generalizability of LWD and identify potential areas for improvement. In particular, it would be beneficial to investigate how LWD performs in environments with highly variable build durations or resource constraints.
