## STRENGTHS

**Strength 1:** Simplicity and On-the-Fly Adaptation  
The LWD approach requires only the outcome of the immediately preceding batch build to adjust its size, eliminating the need for complex offline lookup tables or weighted smoothing models. For example, the Linear-4 BatchStop4 variant incrementally adjusts the batch by a constant factor of 4 when the failure rate is low, and immediately sets the size to 1 upon detecting a high failure streak. This design adheres to Occam’s Razor, yet achieves comparable performance to Bavand et al.’s state-of-the-art dynamic batching without costly pre-computations.

**Strength 2:** Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation  
The authors evaluated LWD on 286,848 commits across 50 large Java projects drawn from the TravisTorrent dataset, applying three fallback algorithms (BatchBisect, BatchStop4, BatchDivide4), and comparing 39 LWD sub-variants against static and existing dynamic batching. They employed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction and Friedman tests with post-hoc Conover analyses, reporting significant median build savings (37.38%–48.86% for LWD variants) and demonstrating statistically significant improvements over static batching in 41 of 50 heuristic pairs.

**Strength 3:** Customizability and Explainability  
LWD’s four core rules (Fallback, Retention, Factor, Customizability) allow engineers to tune minimum/maximum batch sizes, retention/fallback limits, and adjustment factors. As a rule-based system, every decision is transparent—e.g., “if recent failure rate > 40%, next batch size = 1”—which contrasts with opaque machine learning models. This clarity facilitates adoption by build engineers and allows immediate deployment on new projects without historical data.

## LIMITATIONS

**Limitation 1:** Limited Resource Metrics  
The primary performance metric, “percentage of builds saved,” does not directly quantify wall-clock time, CPU cycles, or energy consumption. Although the paper estimates time saved for 41 projects by approximating batch duration as the last commit’s build time plus bisection overhead, this approach may misrepresent true CI resource usage and limits the interpretation of cost savings.

**Limitation 2:** Dataset and Domain Constraints  
The study focuses exclusively on large, Java-based open-source projects (≥2,000 commits) using TravisCI. CI-Skip rules, in particular, are tailored to Java artifacts (e.g., `.java` vs `.md` changes). Consequently, the findings may not generalize to smaller repositories, proprietary codebases, other languages (e.g., Python, C++), or different CI platforms (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).

**Limitation 3:** Approximation in Wall-Clock Analysis  
Wall-clock time savings rely on the simplifying assumption that a batch build’s duration equals the time of its final commit’s build. This ignores potential variations in parallel test execution, caching effects, or hardware heterogeneity. As a result, conclusions about LWD’s time efficiency—especially relative to the baseline dynamic batching algorithm—may be skewed by these unmodeled factors.

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS

**Suggestion 1:** Cross-Platform and Language Evaluation  
Extend the empirical study to include projects in other programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Go) and CI systems (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI). This would test LWD’s adaptability to different build tools, dependency management practices, and commit patterns, and could inform generalized CI-Skip rule sets beyond Java artifacts.

**Suggestion 2:** Dynamic Parameter Tuning Mechanisms  
Investigate automated, feedback-driven methods for adjusting LWD’s factor, retention limit, and fallback threshold during operation. For instance, integrate a lightweight online monitoring component that analyzes recent failure patterns to recalibrate parameters, potentially improving build savings over static experimental values.

**Suggestion 3:** Integration with Resource Consumption Metrics  
Enhance the build simulator to collect and analyze CPU utilization, memory usage, and energy consumption per build. By coupling LWD decisions with multi-dimensional resource metrics rather than solely build counts, future work can optimize batching strategies for holistic CI cost reduction—aligning scheduling decisions with real infrastructure constraints.
