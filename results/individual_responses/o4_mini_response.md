## STRENGTHS

**Strength 1:** Simplicity and On-the-Fly Adaptation  
The paper’s core contribution, Lightweight Dynamic Batching (LWD), derives its strength from an entirely online algorithm that adjusts batch sizes based solely on the immediate past build outcome. Unlike Bavand et al.’s dynamic batching, which depends on offline-generated lookup tables and historical simulations, LWD applies four simple rules (fallback, retention, factor, customizability) to update batch sizes on-the-fly. For example, the Linear-4 BatchStop4 variant incrementally adjusts the batch by a factor of 4 and achieved the highest median build savings (45.57%), demonstrating that lightweight arithmetic operations suffice for real-time CI optimization.

**Strength 2:** Large-Scale Empirical Validation  
The authors evaluated LWD across 286,848 commits from 50 Java-based open-source projects on TravisCI, using a custom build simulator and rigorous statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Friedman, Conover) with effect sizes (Cliff’s Delta, Kendall’s W). This extensive dataset, filtered for master-branch builds and minimum commit counts, provides high confidence in LWD’s reported median savings (up to 48.86% for some variants) and its significant 4.75% improvement over static batching. The replication package and reliance on existing simulators further solidify the study’s reproducibility.

**Strength 3:** Performance Parity with Complex Baselines  
Despite its simplicity, LWD matches the performance of state-of-the-art dynamic batching while outperforming static batching. The paper shows no statistical difference between any LWD variant and Bavand et al.’s dynamic approach, validating the Occam’s Razor principle. For instance, LWD BatchDivide4 achieved similar build savings as the baseline dynamic batching but without requiring weighted smoothing or historical data. This result illustrates that local, lightweight heuristics can be as effective as sophisticated global models, offering practitioners a far more accessible solution.

## LIMITATIONS

**Limitation 1:** Limited Cost Metrics  
The study’s primary metric—percentage of builds saved—does not directly quantify real CI costs such as compute time, energy consumption, or resource utilization. While wall-clock time estimates were computed for 41 projects, these relied on approximating batch build duration by the last commit’s time plus bisection overhead, which may misrepresent actual CI savings and could affect conclusions on time efficiency.

**Limitation 2:** Narrow Dataset and Tooling Scope  
By focusing exclusively on large, Java-based open-source projects using TravisCI (with ≥2,000 commits), the findings may not generalize to smaller or proprietary codebases, other programming languages, or alternative CI platforms (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions). The specificity of CI-Skip rules to Java also limits applicability, as skip heuristics may differ across ecosystems.

**Limitation 3:** Single-Author Implementation Risk  
All simulation, data analysis, and scripting were performed by a single author, exposing the study to potential human error or bias. Although the authors mitigated this by reusing prior replication packages, a multi-researcher validation or independent reimplementation would strengthen internal validity.

## RESEARCH_SUGGESTIONS

**Suggestion 1:** Cross-Platform and Cross-Language Evaluation  
Future work should apply LWD to projects in different programming languages (e.g., Python, C#) and CI environments (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to assess generalizability. Extending CI-Skip rule sets to those ecosystems and measuring LWD’s performance on smaller or proprietary repositories will confirm its broader applicability.

**Suggestion 2:** Integrated Resource-Aware Metrics  
Enhance the performance evaluation by instrumenting real CI pipelines to collect detailed resource usage (CPU hours, memory, energy) and accurate wall-clock times per batch. Coupling LWD with resource-aware scheduling could optimize trade-offs between build count reduction and execution time, providing more actionable insights for practitioners.

**Suggestion 3:** Automated Parameter Tuning and Variant Selection  
Develop meta-heuristics or lightweight reinforcement-learning agents that adjust LWD’s factor values, retention and fallback limits, or even switch among Linear, Exponential, and Mixed variants based on live CI feedback. Such adaptive tuning would relieve engineers from manual parameter configuration and could further improve build savings across varying project phases.
