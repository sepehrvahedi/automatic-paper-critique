    "title": "Dynamic Optimization of LWD’s Configurable Parameters",
    "content": "The paper’s customizability strength could be enhanced by automating parameter tuning (e.g., fallback limits, arithmetic factors) using real-time project metrics. For instance, a hybrid approach could adjust the “Factor Rule” based on recent build durations or failure rate trends, avoiding manual selection of constants like Factor 2 or 3. This aligns with the authors’ future work on adaptive strategy switching (Section 7) but requires concrete mechanisms, such as reinforcement learning policies or rule-based triggers for parameter changes. A potential experiment could compare automatically adjusted Linear LWD variants against fixed-factor baselines, measuring stability and convergence in dynamic environments.",

    "title": "Integrated Prioritization of Build-Time and Build-Count Optimization",
    "content": "Future work should propose a unified optimization framework that balances build count savings and wall-clock time reduction, particularly for high-stakes environments where feedback speed impacts deployment urgency. For example, a cost function could weigh LWD’s build savings against the risk of delayed feedback for critical commits. This direction is motivated by the authors’ observation that baseline dynamic batching occasionally outperformed LWD in wall-clock time savings, suggesting a need for adaptive strategies that switch between batching algorithms based on real-time priorities (e.g., using LWD during low-failure periods and state-of-the-art dynamic batching during high-failure periods). Such a framework would require lightweight monitoring of CI system status and failure trends.",

    "content": "Extending LWD to projects in languages like Python or C++, and CI tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions, would address its current Java/TravisCI specificity. Such research should investigate whether LWD’s local failure-rate-driven updates generalize to ecosystems with different build dependencies or failure patterns. For example, Python projects with less rigid compile-time checks might experience higher inter-commit dependencies, affecting batching efficiency. This would involve recalibrating LWD’s failure thresholds (e.g., retention limit of 20%) and fallback algorithms to account for language-specific build behaviors, ensuring the approach remains lightweight while broadening its applicability.",

This includes testing LWD on smaller projects, projects using different programming languages (beyond Java), projects utilizing alternative build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and projects using different CI platforms (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI). Additionally, investigating the performance of LWD in proprietary projects would provide valuable insights into its applicability in commercial software development settings. This broader evaluation would help to assess the generalizability and robustness of LWD across different software development environments.",

    "title": "Investigating Alternative Integration Strategies for Commit-Skipping Techniques",
    "content": "Given the limited improvement observed when integrating CI-Skip rules with dynamic batching in the current study, future research should explore alternative integration strategies for commit-skipping techniques. This could involve developing new rules that are more complementary to dynamic batching algorithms, or exploring more sophisticated methods for combining the two techniques. For example, instead of applying CI-Skip rules before batching, the system could dynamically adjust the batch size based on the proportion of skippable commits within a potential batch. This could potentially lead to more significant and measurable improvements in build savings by leveraging the strengths of both commit-skipping and dynamic batching.",

Instead of relying on fixed parameter values determined through experimentation, an adaptive tuning mechanism could optimize LWD's performance over time as the project evolves. For instance, the system could monitor the failure rate of batches and automatically adjust the fallback limit or the batch size factor to maintain a desired balance between build savings and detection latency. This adaptive tuning could significantly improve the robustness and effectiveness of LWD in dynamic development environments.",
